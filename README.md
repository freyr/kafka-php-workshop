# PHP + Kafka Workshop

Working repo for a 2-day Kafka-for-PHP-teams workshop. Holds runnable demo
commands, AVRO schemas, slide assets, and a Docker stack with Kafka,
Confluent Schema Registry, Kafka UI, MySQL, Kafka Connect (Debezium CDC for
the Block 6 outbox), and a PHP 8.4 container with
`php-rdkafka` (extension) + [`enqueue/rdkafka`](https://github.com/php-enqueue/rdkafka)
(queue-interop wrapper used by all PHP commands) + `doctrine/dbal` (the
Block 5 idempotency demo), wired through `symfony/console` +
`symfony/dependency-injection` (with PSR-4 autodiscovery via `symfony/config`)
and configured through `symfony/dotenv`.

Per-block facilitator notes live locally in `blocks/` (gitignored — pulled
from the Consulting vault `PHP-Kafka-Research/`). This repo is the runnable
counterpart to that material.

## Running the stack

```sh
make create                                   # bring up kafka + schema registry + kafka-ui + mysql + connect (detached)
docker compose run --rm php composer install  # first-time: install PHP deps in the php container
```

MySQL data in `mysql-data`. Remove them (`docker compose down -v` or
`make destroy`) to reset.

### Running commands

```sh
docker compose run --rm php bin/console list                                    # show all commands
docker compose run --rm php bin/console produce consumer-groups-events -c 5      # produce 5 events
docker compose run --rm php bin/console consume consumer-groups-events -g group-a
```

Two generic commands cover every demo — parametrize them rather than adding new
classes:

```sh
bin/console produce <topic> [-c N] [--key a,b,c | --key-cardinality N] [-p PARTITION] [--payload 'order-{n}']
bin/console consume <topic> [-g GROUP] [-m MAX] [-t TIMEOUT_MS] [--no-commit]
```

`produce` cycles messages through `--key` (stable key→partition hashing) or pins
them to `-p`; `consume` under a named `-g` group keeps its committed offsets
across runs, while omitting `-g` reads the whole topic from earliest under a
throwaway group (the old "inspect" behavior).

For Block 3, a second pair works with **enveloped AVRO** events serialized in
the Confluent wire format against Schema Registry (schemas in `schemas/`):

```sh
bin/console events:produce <order-created|order-updated|order-cancelled|payment-processed|inventory-reserved> \
    [--order-id ID] [--correlation-id ID] [--causation-id ID] [--status STATUS] [--reason REASON]
bin/console events:consume  <topic> [-g GROUP] [-m MAX] [-t TIMEOUT_MS]   # decode + print the envelope
bin/console events:dispatch [topic] [-g GROUP] [-m MAX] [-t TIMEOUT_MS]   # route by event_type
```

`events:produce` builds the metadata+payload envelope, AVRO-encodes it against
the subject's **registered** schema (the fully-qualified record name —
`RecordNameStrategy`, e.g. `com.ecommerce.orders.order_created`), and keys the
message by `aggregate_id`. Schemas are **not** auto-registered on produce —
register them explicitly first with `schema:register` (Block 4), or the encode
fails. `events:consume` decodes via the registry and prints the envelope.

**Multiple event types per topic.** `order-created`, `order-updated`, and
`order-cancelled` all live on the **same** `enet.ecommerce.orders` topic — each
its own subject/compatibility lineage under RecordNameStrategy, all keyed by
`order_id` so one order's lifecycle stays ordered within a partition.
`events:dispatch` is the consumer side: it decodes each message and routes by
`event_type` to a per-type handler (open / update / cancel), ignores types it
doesn't handle (forward-compatibility), and skips non-AVRO bytes rather than
crashing. `order-created` prints a ready-to-paste lifecycle to drive the demo
(`order-updated` → `order-cancelled` → `events:dispatch`), plus the caused
`payment-processed` branch (shared `correlation_id`, linked `causation_id`).

For Block 4, two commands inspect schema evolution against the registry:

```sh
bin/console schema:register <type> [schema-file]   # register a subject's schema (explicit, out-of-band production path → assigns the schema id)
bin/console schema:check    <type> <schema-file>   # is a candidate .avsc compatible with the latest? (CI gate; non-zero exit on fail)
bin/console schema:versions <type>                 # list the registered version lineage [1, 2, …]
```

The production flow is **check → register → produce**: `schema:check` gates a
candidate schema in CI, `schema:register` registers it (the registry assigns the
id and enforces compatibility server-side), and only then can `events:produce`
encode against it.

`schema:check` is the pre-registration compatibility check (read-only). Demo
schemas live in `schemas/orders/evolution/` — `OrderCreated-v2-compatible.avsc`
(optional field + default → PASS) and `-v2-breaking.avsc` (required field, no
default → FAIL).

For Block 5, a delivery-guarantees demo shows at-least-once vs. idempotent
processing, backed by MySQL via `doctrine/dbal`:

```sh
bin/console delivery:consume [topic] [-g GROUP] [--idempotent] [--crash-after N] [-m MAX] [-t TIMEOUT_MS]
bin/console delivery:reset                       # truncate side_effects + processed_events
```

`delivery:consume` applies a side-effect row per order event; `--crash-after N`
applies N then exits **without** committing the Kafka offset (simulating a crash
after the DB commit but before the offset commit), so a recovery run redelivers.
Without `--idempotent` the recovery duplicates the side-effect; with it, the
`event_id` recorded in `processed_events` (same transaction as the side-effect)
makes the redelivery a no-op. The idempotency record and the side-effect commit
in one DBAL transaction; the Kafka offset is committed separately and last.

For Block 6, an outbox demo shows the dual-write problem and its fix, with two
relays — a PHP polling relay and Debezium CDC:

```sh
bin/console outbox:place [--order-id ID] [--naive] [--crash]   # place an order
bin/console outbox:relay [--once] [-b BATCH] [-p POLL_SECS]     # polling relay → AVRO on the orders topic
bin/console outbox:reset                                        # truncate orders + outbox
```

`outbox:place` writes the `orders` row and an `OrderCreated` event to the `outbox`
table in **one** DBAL transaction; `--crash` exits right after the commit (the
event is safe — a relay publishes it later). `--naive` instead commits the order
and then publishes to Kafka directly — with `--crash` that loses the event (the
dual-write trap). `outbox:relay` publishes unpublished rows as AVRO envelopes
(read them with `events:consume enet.ecommerce.orders`), flushing to the broker
before marking each row published, so it is at-least-once by design.

The same outbox table can be shipped by **Debezium CDC** instead of the polling
relay (needs the `connect` service, started by `make create`):

```sh
bin/debezium-register      # waits for Connect, creates topics, registers the connector
bin/debezium-status        # connector + task state (expect RUNNING)
bin/console outbox:place   # then consume the routed topic:
bin/console consume enet.ecommerce.outbox.Order
bin/debezium-delete        # remove the connector
```

The Outbox Event Router routes by `aggregate_type` to `enet.ecommerce.outbox.Order`,
keys by `aggregate_id`, and unwraps the `payload` column to JSON. Config lives in
`config/debezium-outbox-connector.json`. Debezium **3.x** is required for MySQL 8.4
and the `mysql` service runs row-based binlog.

For Block 7, a retry/DLT demo shows error classification, a bounded
in-process-retry → retry-topic chain → Dead Letter Topic, and DLT recovery
(the retry tiers and shared DLT are created by `bin/topic-map`):

```sh
bin/console retry:consume [topic] [--poison=id,…] [--flaky=id,…] [--naive] \
    [--in-process-retries N] [-g GROUP] [-m MAX] [-t TIMEOUT_MS] [--memory-limit MB]
bin/console dlt:inspect [topic] [-t TIMEOUT_MS]            # print DLT error metadata
bin/console dlt:replay  [topic] [--dry-run] [-t TIMEOUT_MS] # re-publish to the original topic
```

`retry:consume` classifies failures: `--poison` ids go straight to the DLT (0
retries), `--flaky` ids fail their in-process retries then route to
`enet.ecommerce.orders.retry.5s` and succeed when that tier re-delivers them
(point a second `retry:consume` at the retry topic to drain it). It acks only
after a message succeeds or is durably routed, so the partition never blocks;
`--naive` drops the routing and exits without acking to show a stuck partition.
Success applies the Block 5 side-effect idempotently, so `dlt:replay` is safe to
re-run — duplicates are skipped on `event_id`. `dlt:inspect` reads the shared
`enet.internal.dead-letters` topic and prints each message's origin, error, retry
count, and reason. Routing/metadata live in `src/Kernel/RetryRouter.php`.

For Block 8, a config-and-operations deep dive — the one block that drops below
the `enqueue` abstraction to raw `\RdKafka`, because the callbacks it teaches
(delivery report, rebalance, statistics) have no `enqueue` surface:

```sh
bin/console config:show [--producer] [--consumer]              # recommended config: value · default · why
bin/console config:stats [topic] [-g GROUP] [-r RUNTIME_SECS] \
    [--slow MS] [--stats-interval MS] [-m MAX] [-t TIMEOUT_MS]  # raw consumer: lag/RTT from the stats callback
```

`config:show` prints the workshop's recommended producer and consumer librdkafka
settings with the librdkafka default and a one-line rationale for each, so every
non-default value can be defended (the values live in `src/Kernel/KafkaTuning.php`
and drop into `KafkaContextFactory::forProducer($overrides)` /
`forConsumer($group, $overrides)` — they are intentionally not baked into the
factory's globals). `config:stats` is a raw php-rdkafka consumer that wires the
`statistics`, `rebalance` (cooperative-sticky, incremental assign), and `error`
callbacks: it prints **consumer lag, broker RTT, and fetch-queue depth** straight
from the librdkafka stats JSON — the only window a PHP consumer has, since there
is no JMX. Produce a backlog first, then add `--slow 40` to watch lag drain in
real time; Ctrl-C does a graceful raw `commit()` + `close()` (immediate
LeaveGroup). Note: php-rdkafka's high-level `KafkaConsumer` has no
`storeOffsets()`, so the at-least-once pattern here is `enable.auto.commit=false`
+ explicit `commit($message)` after processing — exactly what `enqueue`'s
`acknowledge()` does under the hood.

Admin operations against the broker are short bash scripts in `bin/`:

```sh
bin/topic-create consumer-groups-events --partitions 1
bin/topic-map                                       # create the full eCommerce topic map
bin/group-reset offsets-group earliest offsets-events
bin/partition-offsets partitioning-events
```

## Conventions

- **PSR-4 autodiscovery for services and commands.** `config/services.php`
  declares `autowire` + `autoconfigure` defaults and loads
  `Workshop\Kernel\` and `Workshop\Console\` from their respective
  directories. Any class extending `Symfony\Component\Console\Command\Command`
  is auto-tagged `console.command` and registered with the Symfony
  Application. Adding a command means creating one class — no edits to
  `bin/console` or `services.php`.
- **PHP commands use `enqueue/rdkafka` via the `KafkaContextFactory`
  service.** Constructor-inject the factory and call `forProducer()` or
  `forConsumer(string $groupId)`. Direct use of raw `RdKafka\*` classes is
  reserved for the block-08 config deep-dive.
- **Generic, parametrized commands over per-demo classes.** Two commands —
  `ProduceCommand` (`produce`) and `ConsumeCommand` (`consume`) — back every
  block. Topic, key, partition, group, count, and timeout are arguments and
  options, not hardcoded per exercise, so the CLI mirrors real Kafka tools
  (`kcat`, `kafka-console-{producer,consumer}`). Add behavior with a flag, not
  a new class; reach for a new command only for a genuinely distinct operation.
- **The three workshop topics are cataloged in `Workshop\Kernel\Topics`.**
  Cases: `ConsumerGroups`, `Offsets`, `Partitioning` → `consumer-groups-events`,
  `offsets-events`, `partitioning-events`. The commands accept any topic as a
  plain string argument (real-life); the enum is the canonical name list the
  blocks and admin scripts use, not a constraint the CLI enforces.
- **Config lives in `.env`** (`KAFKA_BROKERS`, `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL`,
  `DATABASE_URL`), loaded by `symfony/dotenv`. Per-user overrides go to
  `.env.local` (gitignored).
- **Admin shell scripts in `bin/`** wrap `docker compose exec kafka` calls
  to the Kafka CLI — `enqueue/rdkafka` has no admin API, so these stay
  shell.
- One topic per entity/aggregate, carrying multiple event types over its
  lifetime; subject naming follows `RecordNameStrategy` — the subject is the
  schema's fully-qualified record name (record component in `lower_snake_case`,
  e.g. `com.ecommerce.orders.v1.order_created`), so each event type evolves on
  its own compatibility lineage independent of its topic-mates.
- Polish-language comments are acceptable in workshop exercises (delivered
  in Polish); code identifiers and shipped demos stay in English.
